Edits the tribladers in [Xenon's Playable Classes](https://github.com/XenonA7/xenons-playable-classes) to have more unique basic attacks:

- Uncharged VRPs throw a spread of 3 shots in alternating directions to form the leading edges of a triangle.
- Charged VRPs throw 3 shots in a straight line. Most power is concentrated in the first one.
- Melee attacks are a 3-hit combo instead of 4-hit. NPC tribladers already did this but i extended it to players too.

This gives combat a different rhythm than spheromancers so they feel much more distinct from each other. The original mod is pretty cool but i couldn't shake the feeling that i was just playing "a spheromancer with different combat arts" instead of an entirely new class. So i made this mod of a mod, making combat actually feel different 100% of the time, instead of just 50%! This doesn't affect the balance much but it definitely affects how it feels to control, and it's especially neat earlygame before you have too many combat arts.

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) and then put [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/xpc-triblader-trithrow/releases) in your mods folder. You'll have to install [Xenon's Playable Classes](https://github.com/XenonA7/xenons-playable-classes) the same way of course.
